# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Self-Healing AI Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Self-Healing AI Agent, a system designed to autonomously monitor machine health, predict potential issues, and perform self-remediation actions to prevent failures. The agent will leverage a local AI model to analyze time-series data (e.g., CPU, memory usage) and identify anomalous patterns that precede system degradation.

## 2. Goals

*   **Proactive Monitoring:** Continuously monitor key system metrics.
*   **Predictive Analysis:** Forecast potential system failures or performance degradation based on historical and real-time data.
*   **Autonomous Remediation:** Automatically execute corrective actions to resolve the root cause of predicted issues.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Maintain a comprehensive log of observations, predictions, and actions taken for audit and analysis.
*   **Local-First AI:** Operate using a local AI model to ensure data privacy and reduce latency.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. Data Collection & Monitoring
*   The agent must be able to collect metrics from the host machine at configurable intervals.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   CPU Usage (overall and per-process)
    *   Memory Usage (total, used, free)
    *   Disk I/O
    *   Network I/O
*   The data collection mechanism should be lightweight and have minimal performance impact.

### 3.2. Anomaly Prediction Engine
*   The agent will use a local time-series prediction model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA, or a transformer-based model) to analyze the collected metrics.
*   The model must be trained to recognize patterns that indicate a gradual increase in resource consumption or other anomalous behavior.
*   The system must be able to load and run the pre-trained model for real-time inference.
*   It should generate a "risk score" or a probability of a future issue.

### 3.3. Remediation Engine
*   When the risk score exceeds a configurable threshold, the remediation engine is triggered.
*   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The agent must attempt to identify the process or application causing the anomaly (e.g., the process with the highest memory growth).
*   **Remediation Actions:** The agent will have a library of actions it can perform, such as:
    *   Restarting a specific process.
    *   Clearing application caches.
    *   Logging detailed diagnostic information for the problematic process.
    *   Notifying a human operator if the issue cannot be resolved automatically.
*   Actions should be executed safely, with safeguards to prevent cascading failures.

### 3.4. Logging and Reporting
*   All agent activities must be logged in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
*   **Log entries should include:**
    *   Timestamp
    *   Metric readings
    *   Anomaly prediction details (the "what was found" and "what was predicted").
    *   Remediation action performed.
    *   Outcome of the action.
*   Logs should be stored locally and be easily accessible for review.

## 4. Technical Stack (Proposal)
*   **Programming Language:** Python (due to its strong ecosystem for data science and AI).
*   **Data Collection:** `psutil` library.
*   **AI/ML Framework:** TensorFlow or PyTorch for running the local model.
*   **Model Format:** ONNX for interoperability, if needed.
*   **Logging:** Python's built-in `logging` module.
*   **Architecture:** A modular service-based architecture (Collector, Predictor, Remediator, Logger).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** The agent must be lightweight and consume minimal system resources.
*   **Reliability:** The agent must be resilient and able to recover from its own failures.
*   **Security:** The agent should run with the minimum privileges necessary to perform its tasks.
*   **Configurability:** Key parameters (monitoring intervals, prediction thresholds, remediation actions) must be easily configurable.
