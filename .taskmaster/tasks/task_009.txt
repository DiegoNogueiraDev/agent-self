# Task ID: 9
# Title: Integrate Remediation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the remediation engine with the anomaly prediction and RCA functionalities.
# Details:
Ensure that when an anomaly is detected and the RCA is performed, the appropriate remediation action is executed automatically.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate anomalies and verify that the correct remediation actions are triggered based on the identified root cause.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify potential failure points in remediation actions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the remediation engine to determine where failures might occur and what data or state would need to be saved to enable a rollback.
### Details:
This involves reviewing the code and understanding the flow of the remediation actions.

## 2. Design rollback mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a plan for how to revert the system to a stable state in case of a failure.
### Details:
This includes identifying the necessary steps and any additional data that needs to be stored.

## 3. Implement rollback mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Code the rollback mechanism based on the design.
### Details:
This involves modifying the existing remediation engine code to include the rollback functionality.

## 4. Test rollback mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Test the rollback mechanism to ensure it works correctly and does not introduce new issues.
### Details:
This includes creating test cases that cover various failure scenarios.
