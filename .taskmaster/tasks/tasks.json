This subtask will complete the rollback mechanism by implementing a post-remediation monitoring phase in the main loop. \n\nImplementation Plan:\n1. Modify `main.py`: After a remediation action is performed, the main loop will enter a 'monitoring state'.\n2. Monitoring State: The agent will perform 2-3 additional data collection cycles at a shorter interval (e.g., 5 seconds).\n3. Verification: During monitoring, it will check if the anomaly condition has been resolved.\n4. Outcome:\n   - If the anomaly is resolved, the agent returns to its normal monitoring interval.\n   - If the anomaly persists and is caused by the same offender, the `Remediator`'s exclusion list will prevent a remediation loop. The agent will log this and return to normal monitoring. \n\nThis ensures the agent confirms the outcome of its actions before proceeding.\n</info added on 2025-07-03T00:43:15.533Z>",
