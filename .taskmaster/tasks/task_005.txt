# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Anomaly Prediction Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial structure for the Anomaly Prediction Engine by building a placeholder predictor that can be integrated with the collector.
# Details:
Focus on defining a predictor interface and implementing a mock predictor for testing purposes. The mock predictor will simulate anomaly scoring, allowing for integration with the data collector without requiring a full machine learning model implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to ensure the mock predictor functions correctly and integrates seamlessly with the main application loop.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Predictor Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the `BasePredictor` abstract class with `predict()` and `load_model()` methods.
### Details:
This interface will define the contract for any predictor implementation.

## 2. Implement Mock Predictor [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a `MockPredictor` class that inherits from `BasePredictor` and returns a fixed or random anomaly score for testing purposes.
### Details:
This mock implementation will allow for testing the integration without a real model.

## 3. Add Initial Predictor Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement the basic structure of the `Predictor` class in `predictor.py`, which will be responsible for loading and running the chosen model.
### Details:
For now, this class will load the `MockPredictor` to facilitate testing.

## 4. Write Unit Tests for Mock Predictor [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create tests to ensure the `MockPredictor` behaves as expected.
### Details:
These tests will validate the functionality of the mock predictor.

## 5. Integrate Predictor with Main Loop [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Update `main.py` to pass the metrics from the `Collector` to the `Predictor`.
### Details:
This integration will allow the main application to utilize the mock predictor for testing.
