# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Data Collection Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the data collection module to gather system metrics using the psutil library.
# Details:
Use the psutil library to collect CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network I/O metrics at configurable intervals. Implement a function to return these metrics in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

# Test Strategy:
Run the data collection module and verify that it returns accurate metrics for the system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement error handling in the data collection module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions during data collection.
### Details:
Implement error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent the module from crashing.

## 2. Add logging functionality to the data collection module [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Integrate a logging system to record important events and errors during data collection.
### Details:
Implement logging to help with debugging and monitoring the module's performance.

## 3. Test error handling and logging in various scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Simulate different error conditions and verify that the error handling and logging work as expected.
### Details:
Test the implemented error handling and logging to ensure they cover all necessary scenarios.

## 4. Refine error handling and logging based on test results [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Adjust the error handling and logging based on the test results to improve the module's robustness.
### Details:
Refine the error handling and logging to handle edge cases and improve the module's overall performance.
