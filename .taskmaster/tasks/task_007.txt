# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to identify the root cause of anomalies.
# Details:
Analyze the collected metrics to identify the process or application causing the anomaly, focusing on metrics like memory growth.

# Test Strategy:
Test the RCA functionality with known anomalies to ensure it correctly identifies the root cause.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research visualization tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Investigate existing visualization tools that can be integrated or adapted for RCA functionality.
### Details:
Identify key features and requirements for the visualization tool.

## 4. Implement memory-based root cause analysis logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identifies the top N processes consuming the most memory from a given system metric snapshot. This will be the core logic used by the Remediator.
### Details:
The function will receive a list of process dictionaries (as provided by the collector) and a number N. It will sort the processes by memory usage (e.g., 'memory_percent') in descending order and return the top N processes.

## 2. Design visualization interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a user-friendly interface for the visualization tool that effectively communicates RCA information.
### Details:
Consider user experience and accessibility in the design process.

## 3. Integrate visualization tool with RCA functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Combine the visualization tool with the RCA functionality to enhance the agent's ability to identify and communicate root causes.
### Details:
Ensure seamless integration and compatibility with existing systems.
